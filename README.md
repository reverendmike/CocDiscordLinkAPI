## Using the Service

### Authentication
POST - https://cocdiscordlink.azurewebsites.net/api/login

Payload Example:
```json
{
    "username": "accountname", 
    "password": "accountpassword"
}
```

If successful, you will receive a 200 OK message, with your token
```json
{
    "token": "23jl2k3jh23jKLKk3lh2Kl.A5D46d2312eFealkjkl3Jkl.x923laslkjlKLJlk32lkJlk12jKl3lkjKLJKl1355a"
}
```
If not successful, you will receive a 401 Unauthorized message.

**Retrieving the token expiration time**

Tokens are only valid for 2 hours from the time they are issued. Expiration time is stored in UTC as a claim on the token. Below is an example in C# using Jwt.NET of how to obtain the expiration:

```csharp
var token = "23jl2k3jh23jKLKk3lh2Kl.A5D46d2312eFealkjkl3Jkl.x923laslkjlKLJlk32lkJlk12jKl3lkjKLJKl1355a";
var jwt = new JwtBuilder().WithAlgorithm(new HMACSHA256Algorithm())
    .Decode<Dictionary<string, object>>(token);
var tokenExpireTime = DateTimeOffset.FromUnixTimeSeconds(Convert.ToUInt32(jwt["exp"]));
```
